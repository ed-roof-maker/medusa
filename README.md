# Medusa
A module for parallel processing on a single machine, across multiple CPUs. I can no longer maintain this piece of work, so now it is public. 

I do not have the head space to keep this working.

This project requires rlab_common. You could refactor and make it independent.
You should use yaml for all project configurations.

## How to Unit Test
```
python3 medusa.py
```
This should run the test() method.
